# Code notes

## Algorithms
- Greedy search
    - Finds a solution in a reasonable time
    - not convinced that it is the optimal or at least near optimal solution
- Brute force
    - Left to run for ~8 hours and could only find one solution better than the initial solution
    - Searching all solutions (37!) would take about 1.2x10^40 seconds, so is infeasible
- Simulated Annealing
    - Finds a better solution than greedy search, every time
    - Takes longer to run and come up with a solution
